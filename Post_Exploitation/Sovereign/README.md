# Sovereign Post-Exploitation Framework

This framework provides advanced post-exploitation capabilities with a focus on evasion and automation.

## Features

- **Enhanced Evasion Techniques**: Polymorphic code, sandbox detection, time-based evasion.
- **Advanced Post-Exploitation Modules**: Credential harvesting, persistence, privilege escalation.
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted communication between agent and C2 server.
- **Modular Design**: Easily add new modules and functionalities.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Detailed logging and report generation.

## Directory Structure

- **agent/**: Contains the PowerShell agent script and various payloads for different platforms.
- **c2_server/**: Contains the FastAPI C2 server script and required modules for post-exploitation tasks.
- **cli/**: Contains the CLI script for managing the framework and its commands.

## Usage

### Setting Up the C2 Server

1. **Create a Python virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r c2_server/requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the C2 server**:
    ```bash
    python c2_server/c2_server.py
    ```

### Using the CLI

The CLI provides various commands to interact with the framework.

#### List all registered agents:
```bash
python cli/cli.py list_agents
```

#### Send a command to a specific agent:
```bash
python cli/cli.py send_command --agent_id AGENT_ID --command "Your command here"
```

#### Generate an obfuscated payload for a specific platform:
```bash
python cli/cli.py generate_payload --platform PLATFORM
```

#### Harvest credentials:
```bash
python cli/cli.py harvest_credentials
```

#### Establish persistence:
```bash
python cli/cli.py establish_persistence
```

#### Escalate privileges:
```bash
python cli/cli.py escalate_privileges
```

### Example Commands

1. **Listing all registered agents**:
    ```bash
    python cli/cli.py list_agents
    ```

2. **Sending a command to a specific agent**:
    ```bash
    python cli/cli.py send_command --agent_id 1234-5678-9101-1121 --command "whoami"
    ```

3. **Generating a payload for Windows**:
    ```bash
    python cli/cli.py generate_payload --platform windows
    ```

4. **Harvesting credentials**:
    ```bash
    python cli/cli.py harvest_credentials
    ```

5. **Establishing persistence**:
    ```bash
    python cli/cli.py establish_persistence
    ```

6. **Escalating privileges**:
    ```bash
    python cli/cli.py escalate_privileges
    ```

### Logging and Reporting

Logs are stored in the `c2_server.log` file located in the `c2_server` directory. This file contains detailed information about agent activities and commands executed.
